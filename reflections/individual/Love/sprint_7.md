# Sprint 7

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

    How to plan a project like this in advance. How to decide project structure without knowing how it will be used.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

    I've focused on prducing value for the stake holder this last week, though in doing so, I've not worked on planned user stories. While it breaks the agile work process, I feel this is justified since this last week can be considered an exception to the rule (we don't have time to implement it in the next sprint, as there won't be one). This could have been avoided with better planning

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

    Worked on getting more relevant information from the API, such as alerts.
