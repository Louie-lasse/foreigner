# Sprint 4

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

    Still the same as last week. I have also realized that I have a fairly bad understanding of the different KIPs.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

    Hopefully, as we get 'of the ground', the project will become less interconnected, and we will all see more clearly the advantages of defining independent user stories, which will motivate us to become better at it. How 'I can help': work to get us to that point in the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

    Pushing for prioritization of tha backlog, and trying to motivate others and myself to focus on the user stories that we have agreed (with the stake holder) are the most important.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

    This week I spent a lot of time getting the frameworks (like springboot) up and running, as well as trying to connect to big belly API. This is something that should have been a clear user story, but we found it hard to break down (either it works, or it doesn't).
