# Sprint 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

    Right now, I feel I need a better udnerstanding of the frameworks: how springboot sends different types of objects; how to send parameters to the backend, what kind can be sent and what are the limitations. I feel I need this to better plan for the structure of the project, so that we don't need to revamp the project once we find an obsticle or a better implementation.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

    We want to work in slices, but inorder to do that, everyone need to understand how the backend works, how react and the frontend works, and how they communicate. In order to achive this, I try to show how the code I implemented works, and why I implemented it that way in a short and concise way.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

    Trying to get everyone to follow the prioritization of the backlog, and not going around it by working outside of user stories. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

    I implemented a very simple path finding algorith (with the same architecture as the service for collecting wastebins) and created the pipeline to send that data to the frontend.
