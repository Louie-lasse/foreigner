# Sprint 6

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

    There is still alot of uncertanty about how we can send information to the backend, and that limits/changes the demands on the frontend. The API communication is still something that I want to understand better, in order to more easily work on this and other potential projects.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

    I don't know what to say here, beyond learning the frameworks that we're using.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

    I've worked on relevant user stories, to try to deliver as much as possible to the stake holder.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

    I (along with some other team members) managed to connect to the big belly API, and parse that data then send it to the front end. This removes our reliance on test data.
