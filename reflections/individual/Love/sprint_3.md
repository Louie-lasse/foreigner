# Sprint 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

    I think more intuitively seeing/understanding how the agile process would prevent problems, to motivate me to use/understand them more.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

    Push the entire group (including myself) to use agile as much as possible, to get accustomed to it, and see the advantages more

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

    Though there is much to do in this early stage, I beelive focusing as much as possible on restrictive user stories, and not getting caried away, is an important practice that is important to maintain.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

    I worked on class structure to collect wastebin data, and created a class for generating random, presistent, reasonable data for testing. (this week has been a small sprint, as a lot of us are away for easter).
