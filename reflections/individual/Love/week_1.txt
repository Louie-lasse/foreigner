I currently have a lacking understanding of the agile workflow; while i see the advantages, i can't implement the process very well. I hope to understand it better to prepare for the workplace and aim to achive this by implementing the aligle process in this course (along with solving issues withing the group that arise.

I belive the alige workflow is relatively new to everyone in the group. In order to learn it better, I fully belive in 'us crashing into eachother, then helping eachother solve the resulting process' to be a good way of learning what to do better, and how to work aligle in a group.

Right now, my contributions only stretch to inputs on the social contract, and in the reflections of the exercise we've dont. I hope to be a good asset to the team, and belive that that will be achived by doing the work in front of me and following the social contract.

As we've not begun with the project, I can't think of any contribution yet. As stated above, I hope I will be a good asset, and will help the team by doing my part and helping when ever I can.
