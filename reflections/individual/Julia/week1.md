# Individual reflection week 1

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

    I want to learn how to use the scrum method to work more effectively in coding projects. As of now I have a lot to improve and wish to gain better time and workload management. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

    I can contribute with the knowledge I had prior to this project and with the sprint system I will be able to share my knowledge to contribute to the common goal. 



## What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

    As for the current progress all we have done is the minetest workhop where we learned that we were very unfamiliar with the scrum model and application of it. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

    I have been in contact with a potential Program owner. Hopefully, over the couse of next week, we will get an answer and a project to work on.
