# Individual reflection week 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
What our project will be, at this stage its very unclear as to what project we will have.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As of now, all we can contribute on an individual level is to find someone that can give us a project in less than 3 weeks time. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Sadly we haven't achieved anything worth mentioning this week. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We decided to not use the discord bot idea as it was too simple so my contribution this week was to tell the program owners that their idea wouldn't work for our current project.
