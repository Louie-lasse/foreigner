# Individual reflection week 4

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to be able to properly understand how to implement react and how it works. I want to be able to understand the map api so I can contribute with styling it.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I will contribute by creating an outline for our project in FIGMA so we have a common unerstanding of how the program should look. This will help the team decide if features need to be added or removed, and will also help define our scope better. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have made user stories for this week and will start to develop a Figma prototype.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed by sharing the knowledge I achieved by researching react.
