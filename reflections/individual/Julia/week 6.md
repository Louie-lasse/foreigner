# Individual reflection week 6

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I underrestimated the ammount of research I would have to do to be able to style buttons, implement flexbox and I made my user stories too big. So for this week I will continue with the work i had from last week. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help add new components and create CSS for it. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have made user stories for this week. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed by sharing the knowledge I achieved by researching react and I also started researching Google maps API to understand how it works so I can move the box.
