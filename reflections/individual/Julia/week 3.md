# Individual reflection week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand what the project will be and how I can contribute to the teams common goal. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As this week wasn't as productive as I hoped as I was away on vacation. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Sadly all I have contributed this week is a meeting that established our scope and course of action. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been in meetings this week and started looking on some of the languages we are supposed to use for the project.
