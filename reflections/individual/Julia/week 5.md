# Individual reflection week 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
 For this week I will focus on styling buttons that we have created to display our bins on the map. 
I still want to understand react better as I underrestimated the ammount of research I would have to do to be able to style components with CSS. I also want to learn js better as I haven't used it prior to this course. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can contribute to the groups knowledge of frontend development and implement what I have learned to improve the visual part of our program.  

## What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have made user stories for this week and completed the ones that I had last week. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed by sharing the knowledge I achieved by researching react and the FIGMA design that was approved by our mentor and the rest of the team.
