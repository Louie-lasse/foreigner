# Week 8

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A. I solved some of my route rendering issues in google maps. There are still some
issues, but I have an idea on how to fix it. The only problem is that we probably
don't have enough time to finish it before the demo.
B. I would like to make the application prettier to look at, but I felt like I didn't have
time to learn how to do that since I had to spend a lot of my time on the map.
A -> B. After the project is over I can spend some time learning about styling :D
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A. I wrote comments for my route render code, so that the other team members
could understand what it does, and what parts of the code they need to change/
add if they wanted to extend upon it.
B. It feels like some members have less of an understanding of the google-maps
parts, mainly due to them working on different aspects. It would be nice
if they also got a chance to learn about it.
A -> B. This hasn't really been discussed, but I would be more than happy to
just explain what I have done. I can also share the resource I used in order
to learn about google-maps.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A.  Overall I feel like I was one of the people that took the most initiative
in regards to pushing the group to do sprint retrospectives/reviews and
properly plan sprints.
B. I feel like the sprint retrospectives and planning could have been more thorough,
the problem was that we ended up doing everything on monday(including team reflection)
which resulted in almost a whole day being spent on meetings. This lead to people being very
tired and usually the sprint planning suffered because of it.
A -> B. Maybe we should have had team reflections on a different day than 
sprint retrospective/planning so people have more energy during the meetings.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A. I managed to finish the user story I had since last week.
B. Overall I'm slightly unhappy with my contribution to the deliveries, I think
compared to the others I put in a satisfactory amount of work, but everyone including
me should have put in more time. I do however understand that we all had our 
various reasons for being busy this study period.
A -> B. It did feel like the reasons I couldn't spend as much time on this course
as I wanted, were a bit out of my control. However I can't claim that I spent
my time with maximum efficiency, so there is of course always room for improvement
there.
