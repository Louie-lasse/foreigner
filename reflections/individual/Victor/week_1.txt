What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn Agile.
Right now I know a little bit about Agile.
I'm going to learn Agile through attending lectures, self studying through online
resources and actively practicing Agile ways of working throughout this project.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

By sharing information that is valuable to the team.
This week I have not really gotten the opportunity to share information.
Going forward I will share information with my team whenever I think it can
help them learn something new.
