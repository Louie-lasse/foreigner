# Week 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A. I'm working with a map from google maps api in react
B. I'm having issues with the map not centering properly on reload, so I want to understand how to fix this problem.
A -> B. There is some documentation for the google-maps api package I'm using, I will try to look through it and see what it says about centering the map.
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A.
B.
A -> B.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A. It felt like some team members were unsure of what they should do.
B. I want everyone to know what they should do.
A -> B. I will ask everyone during the next sprint planning if they know what they should work with, and if they say no, I will try to think of something together with them.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A. I'm mainly responsible for setting up the map and learning more about how it works.
B. I would like to branch out to work more with the API.
A -> B. If I manage to finish my work with the map, then perhaps I can spend some time working with the API. Even if I don't get the chance to work with the API, I can still check out what the others have been working with.
