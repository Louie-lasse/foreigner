# Week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to write user stories better.
A. I think some of the user stories I have written are too general, I also had a hard time writing some of them without including "As a developer"
B. I want to write clear an concise user stories that follow the correct user story convention
A -> B.  Spend more time thinking about user stories, identify the correct "owner", split them up into smaller pieces if needed.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By sharing resources that I find online with them. 
I feel like I have done what I can in regards to this, this week.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've reminded people of scrum ideas such as MVP and clear and concise user stories. It's been a bit of a rocky start but we are trying to make the best out of the situation.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was a part of the planning stages for the application, things like it being a java backend and suggestions for some simple code we could start writing to get the project started.
