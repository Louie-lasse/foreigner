# Week 6

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A. I'm still working with google-maps-api, right now I want to make a button
that centers the map.
B. I'm having issues with getting some of the features from google maps to work,
mainly centering based on the browsers geolocation.
A -> B. I will try to find some tutorials on youtube that are somewhat similar
to our application so that I can emulate what they are doing. Otherwise I think
it might be a react issue instead of an google maps api specific one, so I might
have to look up some react stuff.
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A.
B.
A -> B.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A. I feel like I'm taking the initiative when it comes to setting up sprint
retrospectives and sprint planning.
B. I want to continue with this since it feels like the other group members
aren't thinking about this aspect of the project a lot.
A -> B. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A. I didn't get to spend as much time working on the code as I would like, struggled
with getting the centering functionality done.
B. I want to finish my taks on time.
A -> B. "Easy" solution would be to spend more time working on the code, on
a more serious note I might need to budget my time better.
