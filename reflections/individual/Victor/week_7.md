# Week 7

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A. I need to implement actual routes in between the markers on the map, instead
of just having black lines like we have now.
B. I'm having trouble understanding how rendering routes work in google-maps,
so ideally I would like to understand how to render routes.
A -> B. I'm gonna try to look for another tutorial + try to understand the route render
example from the documentation. Then it's probably just trial and error until I 
get it right.
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A. Not much to add this week
B.
A -> B.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A. 
B.
A -> B.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A. Unfortunately I didn't finish the user story for routes this week.
B. Ideally I would have finished it.
A -> B. I could have spent more time working on it, but the issues I faced
were unexpected to me and very frustrating to solve.
