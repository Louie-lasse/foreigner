What do I want to learn or understand better?
A. It's easter this week but some group-members still wanted a sprint. Becuase of 
easter I have not been able to contribute much. The working members this week have
made a major overhaul and the project have a frontend-directory in JavaScript with React.js and a
backend-directory in Java with Springboot. I am not familiar with Springboot, JavaScript nor
React.js so I am motivated to learn these new tools. 
B. I want to learn and understand Springboot, JavaScript and React.js.
A->B. By researching about the new tools.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A. Becuase of easter, the majority of the group including me have not been able to
do much work this week. 
B. I think that the tools are new for pretty much everyone except for one. I want to learn the
new tools and hopefully we can share what we learn with the group so everyone knows how to handle
the tools.
A->B. Research about the tools, help eachother and ask questions when you don't understand.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A. I have attended a meeting about sprintplaning, a few of the group wanted to work a sprint this week despite
easter. 
B. Next week I will be able to contribute more when it's not easter. As a srum master I will check that everyone
is okay with the new directories and tools that was implemented this week.
A->B. Ask everyone how they feel about the environment on sprint planning-meeting.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A. I have not been able to contribute because of easter.
B. Next week I will be able to contribute. I will have to learn the new tools and environments.
A->B. I will do suitable user stories and research on how to implement said user stories.
