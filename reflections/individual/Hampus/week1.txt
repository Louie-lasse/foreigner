What do I want to learn or understand better?
A. I have a basic understanding of the Scrum-framework and an insight into how sprints work. 
B. I want to have a better understanding of Scrum and be more experienced with sprints.
A->B. By following the course’s lectures and through projects and workshops with my group I will get more educated in the subject and have more practical experience. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A. The course started this week so there haven’t been any chances to help other than as a group trying to get everyone involved.
B. When the project is in a later phase I should help the group with my previous experience to improve those knowledges even more.
A->B. Be active on leisures and have a constant conversation with the group.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A. I was the scrum leader at the Minetest-workshop. I helped the group by project management and communicating with the other groups and product owners. I got a better understanding of the scrum masters tasks and how to work through sprints more efficiently.
B. For now, the contribution is enough since we’ve only had two workshops. But I should still contribute to the group and communicate with them.
A->B. Doing my tasks as whatever role I am assigned in the real project should be a target image. Also ensure that the group follows the framework of Scrum.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A.I have attended a meeting where we wrote a social contract. I also attended two workshops with the group.
B. I should continue to be active in the group and follow our project goal.
A->B. Continue as I do and communicate with the group.
