A. I semi-understand JavaScript-syntax and React.js. I do not
have a good understaning of SpringBoot and it seems that we
have used SpringBoot wrongly in the project when I talk
with classmates.

I didn't fully have the time to properly research about the
tools and understand them.

in my own projects now that the course has ended. The stake holder
is open to continuing working with us so maybe I will have the time
to implement and understand it then.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A. This was the last sprint, I have helped people understand the

in other projects or courses.

each other.
