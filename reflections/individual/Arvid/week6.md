## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A. I currently know nothing about APIs or how to request information from elsewhere.
B. I want to understand how the company's API works and also how to write code in java to aquire the data from them.
A -> B. Firstly I need to go through the BigBelly pdf about thier API on how to request from there and etc. 
When I have enough knowledge about it I will need to read up on how to request from API in java.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

As always I will share necessary information and webbsites with the teammates if I think someone will benefit from it. 
Ofcouse also help teammates if they are stuck with something and I can provide assistance.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A. We dpn't have enough KPIs.
B. We need more KPI:s.
A -> B. I have made an velocity graph thats updated to current date. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A. I have worked a lot with the API and how to request from it. I also worked some with the backend on how to make a graph, node and edges to make the path through all wastebins. I did some thinking and little coding at home and then worked together with a group member since it was a pretty difficult problem to solve and had to be well thought through.
B. I haven't got the API to work completely yet so need more knowledge about API requests in java.
A->B. I will need to do more research on API requests and how to do it in java.
