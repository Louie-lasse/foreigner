What do I want to learn or understand better?
    I want to understand the whole concept of Agile more to improve efficency.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    With the still limited knowledge I have about this concept I can still contribute with what I know and during this project 
    we will probably all remind each other about thing which will lead to everyone learning something new and being satisfied.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
    We haven't done much yet since it's just the first week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
    Too early to answer since we haven't decided project yet. :)
