What do I want to learn or understand better?

    Since we haven't decided a project yet I don't really know what I want to learn
    exept like I said last week about learning more about the proccess and mindset of scrum.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

    I will stay updated and try to learn new thing that I think the team or myself will benefit from. 
    I can then share what I've learnt.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

    We haven't started yet.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

    We haven't started yet.
