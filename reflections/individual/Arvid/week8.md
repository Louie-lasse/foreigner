# Week 8

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
A. This is the last sprint and only small fixest left to do. Most of the things we want done is in the front end to make the product look better and have a bit more functionality. So I will try to improve the frontend a bit.
B. Since the only thing I know about react is what I learnt on the workshop I did in the beginning of the project and which was pretty basic I will have to read up on react again. I havent participated in the coding of the front end at all almost so I will have to update myself on how it looks like and how to work there. 
A -> B. I will need to first look at the code we have so far and then see what I can do. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I will as mentioned before always help group members if needed and share my knowledge and also links etc if it can be helpfull to someone else.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I didn't get much done this sprint coding wise.
