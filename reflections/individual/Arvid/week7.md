# Week 7

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
A. Im still stuck with the API request since there is so many things that has to match and there aren't a lot of information on this on google
B. I still want to access the API
A -> B. I have sent an email to the bigbelly company as our stackholder suggested. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I informed the team about the struggle I had with the API request and one of the teammembers decided to help me and see if he could figure out how to do it. I gave him the code I so far had but didn't got to work and I also sent him linkes to websites that I thought may have some clues on how to access the API.
I also gave a link I found usefull when coming to parsing json in java since that was his task and I was looking into that a bit the week before. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Participating in all meeting and also discussing with the stakeholder about what we should focus on now since there isn't a lot of time left. Make prioritizations with the user stories and make sure that the atleast the MVP is aquired. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Since I was stuck with the API I worked some on the refactor with two other team members. A refactor that for example was necessary to be able to use all the data from the API when we later get it to work. I also changed the wastebin class so that it can take all info that the API will give us.
