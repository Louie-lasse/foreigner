# week 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A. I know nothing about react and we will need knowledge about it to work with the frontend
B. I want to learn react so that I can contribute with both front and backend.
A->B. I will read through the react workshop one of the teammembers sent us.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I will share usefull links and webbsites I find online and as always try to help if there is something I know more about.
Watching the workshop may give me knowledge that I can share since all of us are pretty new to react.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I attended all meetings and participated when writing the team reflections etc. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A. Since this only was half a week I spend most time watching the react workshop and did the exercises given there. 
B. So far I haven't contributed with that much code, I have just tried to get as much information as possible before starting.
A->B. Next sprint I will have a user story to complete and therefore I'm contributing with actual code and not only improving my knowledge.
